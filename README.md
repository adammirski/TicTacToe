This program is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe,
designed to be played in a console or terminal window. It supports both
a two-player mode, where two human players can compete against each other,
and a one-player mode, where a human player can play against the computer.
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with players taking turns to place their
tokens (either 'X' or 'O') on the grid. The goal is to be the first to get
three of one's own tokens in a row, column, or diagonal.
